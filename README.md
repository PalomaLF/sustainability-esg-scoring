# Driving Sustainable Impact: Big Corporations and the UN SDGs

_A comparison between countries' SDG progress score and its evolution over time and ESG scoring of major companies in those countries. This proyect is the final proyect of IronHack Data Analytics bootcamp_


Sustainability encompasses a much broader spectrum of considerations beyond just climate change and contamination. It involves meeting the needs of the present without compromising the future; balancing not only environmental aspects, but also economic and social factors to ensure long-term well-being, recognizing that ending poverty must go hand-in-hand with strategies that build economic growth and address a range of social needs. With this objective in mind, the UN created the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, 17 goals to address global challenges such as poverty, inequality, climate, environmental degradation, peace, and justice, aiming to achieve them by 2030.

## Data 
For this analysis, I have used the SDG Index ranking (published by the SDG Index and Dashboards Report in collaboration with the UN) which compiles the performance of each country in relation with the SDGs since the year 2000. For company rating analysis, I have used Sustainalytics (par of Morningstar) ESG Ratings publicly available on their website.

You can find the data I have used, both original and transformed, in the 'data' folder, and all the code in the 'notebooks' folder. For data visualization I have used Tableau Desktop, the book is included in the project.


## Conclusions

In the dashboards we can see the differences in performance in all the countries from which there is available data (colored). This the index for 2022, which is the last available data, as it is updated in November every year. We can appreciate a big difference between continents and countries, especially significant between industrialized and non-industrialized countries, or with countries with a lower Human Development Index.

However, if we look at the evolution over time, we can see that the performance in general is improving. There are some countries that have started taking action and we can see it in their evolution (Spain for instance has come from a score of 73.5 in 2000 to a score of 80.3 in 2022).

Big companies have integrated the SDGs into their sustainability and social responsibility goals, aligning business strategies with the global priorities set by the UN to contribute positively to society and the environment.

A company's alignment with the SDGs and overall sustainability practices can impact its risk rating by increasing resilience to environmental, social, and governance risks, potentially lowering borrowing costs and increasing access to capital. This is measured through ESG ratings, which focus on a company's environmental and social impact, as well as its governance structure:

1.	Environmental Factors: This includes a company's impact on the environment, such as its carbon emissions, energy usage, waste management, and conservation efforts.
2.	Social Factors: This assesses the company's relationships with its employees, customers, suppliers, and the communities in which it operates. It also considers aspects such as diversity and inclusion, labor practices, and human rights policies.
3.	Governance Factors: This evaluates the company's leadership, executive pay, shareholder rights, and overall corporate governance structure.


In this part of the analysis again, we also see a significant difference between industrialized and non-industrialized countries: rating agencies focus on large companies, multinationals, etc., which are not typically found in non-industrialized countries. Also, companies in these areas tend to report less their sustainability initiatives.

However, by comparing the avg. SDG Index of countries with and without big corporations, we can already conclude that the existence of a business fabric has a positive impact on the progress towards the SDGs. Comparing SDG Indexes per country and the average ESG score its companies, we can see a correlation between both scores â€“ the lower the ESG risk, the higher the SDG Index of their company. So yes, the efforts of our companies in sustainability have a positive and significant impact in the progress towards SDGs.

After a correlation analysis, we can also see the goals in which they have a higher positive impact:
1.	SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure: Companies play a crucial role in promoting sustainable industrialization, technological innovation, and the development of resilient infrastructure.

2.	SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth: Businesses can influence the promotion of decent work, sustainable economic growth, productivity, and innovation, as well as the eradication of child labor and forced labor.
However, we can also see the negative impact of heavy industrialization in another SDG
3.	SDG 12: Responsible Production and Consumption: Companies have the responsibility to manage their operations sustainably, promote responsible consumption, and reduce waste and pollution.

It's evident from these points that businesses have a significant impact on various aspects of sustainable development, not just in their operations, but also in influencing broader societal and economic factors aligned with the SDGs.

Even though we can already see the impact of companies on the progress towards the SDGs, fewer than 30% of companies worldwide report at least one quantitative sustainability metric, with even lower rates in less industrialized countries. 

Considering the existing correlation between the ESG score and the SDG Index, it is necessary for companies to engage in sustainable development initiatives to achieve the goals set by the UN for 2030. This integration will reinforce companies' commitment to sustainability and social impact, fostering innovation and resilience while also enhancing reputation and brand value.
